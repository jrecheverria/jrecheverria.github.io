Engaged to my amazing fianc√©e, Dog Dad to Pongo, Software Engineer, Avid Runner.

**Enagaged**: I met the love of my life in a small mom & pop diner in Florida back in highschool. Since then, it has been a decade of love and counting. We got engaged in 2023 and are getting married in 2025!

**Dog Dad**: My fiancee and I got our dog Pongo in the summer of 2022, it was the best decision we've ever made.

**Software Engineer**: Backend engineering crafting solutions at Citi. Formerly worked as a backend engineer at JP Morgan & Chase. I spend my free time programming for fun and performing deep dives on popular technologies.

**Runner**: Fell in love with running in 2023. Currently conquering 10k distances, with my sights on the Miami Marathon!

In my free time I love to spend time with my fiancee, go on long runs with our dog Pongo, and spend time with family and friends.
